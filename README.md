# Minecraft Markup Language (MCML)

Why bother writing long complex JSON text for Minecraft when you could just use simple text syntax?

MCML is built on [Fanciful](https://github.com/mkremins/fanciful), so you can use Fanciful's [FancyMessage](https://github.com/mkremins/fanciful/blob/master/src/main/java/mkremins/fanciful/FancyMessage.java) class once you create a message using MCML.

Documentation can be found on the wiki page linked below.

Version 3.0.0 is currently in development. The syntax has been changed and overall, the library is a lot more stable and bug-free. It also now uses Fanciful v0.4.0 which no longer requires reflection/NMS to work. Achievement and item hover support is currently not implemented.
